      Read this properly.<br>
      I’m not someone who usually does things like this. You already know that.
      I don’t sit and plan gestures or write long messages or mark days on a calendar.
      But being in a relationship also means doing a few things for the sake of your partner's happiness,
      especially when you know it’ll make the other person smile.
      So yes, this exists. I coded this site for you.
      Don’t let it get to your head.

      We’ve been in this thing for about four months now.
      Technically five (if you count that one-month breakup)
     that was also an experience, So yeah, that happened. Consider it a trial run.

      What we have is calm.
      Not dramatic. Not loud. Not chaotic.
      It’s stable, even if we never bothered to define it properly.
      We’re in a relationship — that part is clear —
      we just didn’t waste time putting labels on every step.

      I’m also not doing this because it’s Rose, Propose Day
      or whatever made-up occasion it is.
      If today didn’t exist, this page still would.
      I don’t act based on dates.
      I act when something feels settled.

      You’re quiet. You don’t overtalk.
      You don’t try to be loud or impressive. You are feminine.
      You have got a great brain on your shoulder.
      And that’s exactly what I like. (sometimes you argue but that's a different story)
      You listen.
      You say things when they actually matter.

      This isn’t about promises or future plans.
      I’m staying in the present.
      Right now, I know what I want.
      And I don’t see the point in leaving it unsaid.
